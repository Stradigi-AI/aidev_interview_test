Functional requirements:
- Build a classification pipeline.
- Train a model using your pipeline and the provided IRIS dataset.
- Serve the model via a `/predictions` endpoint.
	```
  curl -X POST "localhost:5000/predictions" -H  "accept: application/json" -H  "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"feat_1\":val_1,\"feat_2\":val_2}"
  ```

Non-functional requirements:
- must use python
- must not use any REST helper library. Ex: Flask-RESTful, Connexion
- must use Git for version control
