# AI Dev Interview Test

Build an ML Pipeline that cleans the [provided dataset](data/iris.csv) and trains a model.

The pipeline should contain at least one custom preprocessing step implemented with numpy or pandas.

The other blocks can be implemented with the ML library of your choice.

Once trained, use the fit model to make predictions.

You can write an example file or serve the model as an endpoint of a REST API.

The repository should include a readme with instructions on how to make predictions
